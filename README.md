## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Scss
- Gulp - autoprefixer - postcss - sourcemaps - cssnano - concat - terser -rename

### What I learned

Well, i learned how to get data from a REST Api, use it and show it on the html and i have improved my 
responsive skills, i think. 

### Continued development

Ok, so, since i made it with JS Vanilla and i'm a newbie on this yet, i will re-develop this on the future, but with React.js; in order to optimize the code and improve the function that show you information from country that you have clicked. Also, i want to stop the over Scss nesting use.
- [03-08-22] Replaced the API url to https://restcountries.com/v2/all, because the old one wasn't working anymore.

### Useful resources

- [Simple Search in JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWkPXbQXArk) - This helped me with the functions that allow you to search countries.
